    <h1> UX/UI Case Study</h1>
    <h2> Design of a Health Campanion Super App</h2>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <h4 class="number" id="one">1</h4>
    <h3>User Research and Persona Creation</h3>
    <p>
        I believe interviews would be the best approach. Since it is a two way conversation, the interviewed may bring up information I would not have ever thought of and that would not have fit in a limited survey answer.

        Key Questions I would ask in an interview:
        What would you look for in a medicare app?

    <h4>Persona</h4>
    <p>
        Persona
        Judith – 70 years old
        She has smthn serious and would always have to take a taxi to the hospital. She doesn’t mind getting out of the house and seeing the nurses, but she does find it a little tiresome. When there is a small concern, she won’t even bother making an appointment, thinking the travel is not worth it. She  also has trouble with the phone system, constantly having to answer prompts to properly assign her to the correct receptionist to take her appointment. She would find it useful to have an app to book her appointments and will give her access to a professional to resolve minor concerns.
